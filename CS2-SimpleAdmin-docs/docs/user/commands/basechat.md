## Communication Guidelines

### Professional Communication

1. **Be clear and concise** - Don't spam long messages
2. **Use appropriate command** - Don't center-spam trivial messages
3. **Check for typos** - You represent the server
4. **Avoid excessive colors** - Can be hard to read

### Spam Prevention

1. **Don't overuse center say** - Very intrusive for players
2. **Space out announcements** - Don't flood chat
3. **Use HUD say for persistent info** - Less annoying
4. **Coordinate with other admins** - Avoid duplicate messages

### Effective Messaging

**Good Examples:**
```bash
css_cssay "ðŸŽ¯ New map voting system available! Type !mapvote"
css_psay PlayerName "Hey! Please enable your mic or use team chat"
css_asay "Checking player demos for possible aimbot"
```

**Poor Examples:**
```bash
css_csay "hi"  # Don't use center say for trivial messages
css_cssay "a" "b" "c" "d"  # Don't spam center messages
css_say "asdfasdfasdf"  # Unprofessional
```

---

## Silent Mode

Admins can use silent mode to hide their activity:

```bash
css_hide  # Toggle silent mode
```

When in silent mode:
- Chat messages still work
- Admin name might be hidden (depends on config)
- Useful for undercover moderation

---

## Configuration

### Show Activity Type

Controls how admin actions are displayed:

```json
"ShowActivityType": 2
```

**Options:**
- `0` - Hide all admin activity
- `1` - Anonymous ("An admin says...")
- `2` - Show name ("AdminName says...")

---

## Chat Restrictions

### Respecting Gags

Remember that:
- `css_asay` works even if admin is gagged (admin chat)
- Other commands respect communication penalties
- Can't use chat commands while silenced

### Permission Requirements

All chat commands require `@css/chat` permission:

```bash
css_addadmin STEAMID "Name" "@css/chat" 50 0
```

Or add to a group with chat permission:
```bash
css_addgroup "#moderators" "@css/chat,@css/kick" 50
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Messages not showing

**Check:**
- Do you have `@css/chat` permission?
- Are you silenced/gagged?
- Check console for errors
- Verify player is connected (for css_psay)

### Colors not working

**Check:**
- Use correct color code syntax: `{red}`
- Some commands may not support colors
- Different chat systems handle colors differently

### Players can't see center/HUD messages

**Check:**
- CS2 client-side chat settings
- Conflicting HUD plugins
- Server console for errors
